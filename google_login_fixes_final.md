# Google Login Fixes for YouTube Chapter Generator

## Issues Identified and Fixed

After a thorough investigation of the code, I identified and fixed the following issues that were preventing Google login from working:

1. **API Endpoint Mismatch**
   - The auth.js file was using incorrect API endpoints
   - Updated config.js to use the correct API endpoints:
     - API_BASE_URL: "https://new-ycg.vercel.app/api"
     - AUTH_BASE_URL: "https://new-ycg.vercel.app/api/auth"

2. **Content Security Policy Issues**
   - The CSP was too restrictive and didn't allow connections to the API endpoints
   - Updated the manifest.json to include connect-src for the API endpoints:
     ```json
     "content_security_policy": {
       "extension_pages": "script-src 'self'; object-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' https://new-ycg.vercel.app https://www.googleapis.com"
     }
     ```

3. **Google Button Initialization Problems**
   - The Google button initialization logic was complex and not working correctly
   - Simplified the button initialization to directly target the button containers:
     ```javascript
     // Find the Google sign-in button containers
     const googleSignInButton1 = document.getElementById('google-signin-button');
     const googleSignInButton2 = document.getElementById('google-signin-button-auth');
     
     // Add buttons to both containers
     if (googleSignInButton1) {
       googleSignInButton1.innerHTML = '';
       googleSignInButton1.appendChild(createGoogleButton());
     }
     
     if (googleSignInButton2) {
       googleSignInButton2.innerHTML = '';
       googleSignInButton2.appendChild(createGoogleButton());
     }
     ```

4. **Token Exchange Issues**
   - The token exchange with the backend was not handling errors correctly
   - Improved error handling and added better logging:
     ```javascript
     try {
       response = await fetch(GOOGLE_LOGIN_ENDPOINT, {
         method: 'POST',
         headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
         body: JSON.stringify({ token: token, platform: 'chrome_extension' })
       });
       
       console.log(`[Auth] Backend response status: ${response.status}`);
       
       const responseText = await response.text();
       console.log(`[Auth] Backend response text: ${responseText.substring(0, 100)}...`);
       
       if (!response.ok) {
         // Error handling logic...
       }
       
       // Parse the response text as JSON
       try {
         data = JSON.parse(responseText);
       } catch (jsonError) {
         console.error("[Auth] Failed to parse response as JSON:", jsonError);
         throw new Error("Invalid response format from server.");
       }
     } catch (fetchError) {
       console.error("[Auth] Fetch error during token exchange:", fetchError);
       throw new Error(`Network error during login: ${fetchError.message}`);
     }
     ```

5. **Server Error Handling**
   - Added specific handling for 500 server errors:
     ```javascript
     if (response.status === 500) {
       throw new Error(`Server error (500). Please try again later or contact support.`);
     }
     ```

## Current Status

The Google login button should now work correctly in terms of the extension code. However, the backend server is still returning a 500 error, which is a server-side issue that needs to be addressed separately.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix the Backend Server**
   - The server is currently returning a 500 error for all requests
   - This is a server-side issue that needs to be investigated
   - Check the server logs for more details about the error
   - Verify the Google OAuth token verification process

2. **Test the Google Login**
   - Once the server is fixed, test the Google login again
   - Verify that the user is properly authenticated
   - Ensure that the user's credits are displayed correctly

3. **Implement Monetization Features**
   - Once the Google login is working properly, proceed with implementing the monetization features
   - Create the web application for managing credits and purchases
   - Set up Stripe integration for payment processing
